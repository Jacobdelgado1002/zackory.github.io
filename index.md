  I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu">The Robotics Institute</a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, where I lead the <a href="https://rchi-lab.github.io">Robotic Caregiving and Human Interaction (RCHI) Lab</a>.
  My research explores intelligent physical human-robot interaction, with applications in healthcare robotics.

  Previously, I received my PhD in Robotics at Georgia Tech advised by <a href="http://ckemp.bme.gatech.edu/">Charlie Kemp</a>.
