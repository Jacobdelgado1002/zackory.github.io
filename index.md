Hello! I am currently a senior at the University of Puerto Rico Mayagüez, pursuing my Bachelor in Computer Science and Engineering. I am particularly interested in research involving the deployment of AI systems in interdisciplinary applications like healthcare and assistive technology. Specifically, I am intrigued by the prospects of deploying AI technologies in resource-constrained environments, such as the rural and underprivileged areas of my home country of Puerto Rico. 

My future career goal is to pursue a PhD and later post-doctoral studies, allowing me to explore the multidisciplinary applications of AI in greater depth while developing novel systems that address societal challenges. Furthermore, I aim to enter academia at my local institution to mentor and inspire future generations of Puerto Rican students, nurture their curiosity, and guide them toward academic success.
